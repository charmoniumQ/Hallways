# Hallways

Hallways is a project to help people navigate the littered layout of the UT Dallas campus. By using WiFi network signals, Hallways aims to help the user find their location indoors. There's no need for battery draining GPS (which doesn't work well indoors anyway). Users will be able to open up an app and easily get to their classes.
