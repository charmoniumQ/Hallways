# Hallways

Hallways is a project to help people navigate the littered layout of the UT Dallas campus. By using WiFi network signals, Hallways aims to help the user find their location indoors. There's no need for battery draining GPS (which doesn't work well indoors anyway). Users will be able to open up an app and easily get to their classes.

## Specifications:
- Empirically measure the signal strength of existing semi-permanent access points.
- Consult a database containing the signal strength of various access points with respect to the location.
- Locate self on client with room-to-room accuracy.
- Display location on a map.
- Either (based on user option) continuously update location or update location upon request.
- Passively acquire user data (without sacrificing privacy) to improve results.
- Allow users to write their location in a link and send it to other users who can open that location on a map.

- [PlaceLab](http://ntrg.cs.tcd.ie/undergrad/4ba2.05/group1/) is similar, but wants much wider coverage (being able to locate yourself anywhere) and less accuracy (10m - 30m).
